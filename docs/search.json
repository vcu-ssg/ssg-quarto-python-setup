Each shell (e.g., powershell, zsh and bash) is slightly different but they work about the same.\nEach time a terminal window opens the shell executes commands found in a special “run command” file. This approach permits the shell to dynamically adapt to the state of the computer at the time a shell opens.\nTo get all the programs to smoothly work together we need to add (or verify) that a few commands exist in these run command (or rc) files.\n\nPick your OS -&gt;MacLinuxWindows\n\n\nSelect your OS from one of the tabs.\n\n\nA mac uses the zsh shell. Configuration commands are stored in the .zshrc file stored in the users home (~) directory.\n(add stuff here)\n\n\nYour linux machine most probably uses the bash shell. Configuration commands are stored in the .bashrc file stored in the users home (~) directory.\n\n\nWindows uses several different shells: CMD, powershell and powershell-core. Our preferred shell for this activity is powershell.\nPowershell stores it’s run commands in the file: $ENV:USERPROFILE\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1. I know, kill me. BUT, powershell gives the abbreviation $PROFILE to permit easier access.\nOn some machines, the $PROFILE folder may not yet, so we’ll want to create the folder before we edit the file.\nOpen a powershell terminal and paste the following command\n# Read the folder path from $PROFILE variable\n$folderPath = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($PROFILE)\n\n# Check if the folder exists and do your thing\nif (-not (Test-Path -Path $folderPath -PathType Container)) {\n    New-Item -Path $folderPath -ItemType Directory\n    Write-Host \"Folder created: $folderPath\"\n} else {\n    Write-Host \"Folder already exists: $folderPath\"\n}\nNow, let’s edit (or create) the $PROFILE\ncode $profile\nand look for the following commands. If they don’t exist, paste them to the bottom of the file. If they exists, make sure that those in the $PROFILE match those below.\n# These settings disable annoying quarto messages\n$env:DENO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1               # to warning about deno upgrades\n$env:DENO_TLS_CA_STORE=\"system\"           # to stop the BAD CERTIFICATE deno warning\n$env:PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION=1     # for Python 3.11 above, to disable warning message RE: debugging\n$env:VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=0         # set to 1 to disable venv prompt change\n\n# This is the code that syncs everything up\n$env:QUARTO_PYTHON=$(pyenv which python)  # to work with pyenv global or local python\n$var = $(poetry env info -e 2&gt; $null)\nif ($var -ne $null) {\n  Write-Output \"QUARTO_PYTHON set to Poetry VENV\"\n  $env:QUARTO_PYTHON=$var                 # override with venv python as needed\n} else {\n  Write-Output \"QUARTO_PYTHON set to $(pyenv version)\"\n}\nSave the profile, close your shell and reopen your shell.
