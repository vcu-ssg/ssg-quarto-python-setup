title: Quarto
---

Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit, with many new new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

Visit this site to install Quarto:

Here is a link directly to the VSCODE install page:

## Safety tips!

* Install pyenv/python and VSC first

* Install the vscode QUARTO extension (see the docs)

* Don't just stop at installing the software. RTFM

* FINISH THE PAGE - you'll see that there are several additional steps (like *pip install jupyter matplotlib plotly*)

You should be able to replicate the example in their guide.

## Troublshooting

You can verify that all was installed correctly (except the VSC stuff) using the *quarto check* command.

```powershell

quarto check

```
