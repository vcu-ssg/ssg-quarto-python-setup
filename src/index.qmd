Getting your machine ready for software development can sometime be challenging, especially if over time you've accumulated lots of software for individual classes.

This site offers a process for preparing your computer for python development using VS code and Quarto.  Those on Mac (zsh shell) and Linux (bash shell) have an easier time.  Those on Windows have a tougher time because of the multitude of shells (e.g., CMD, powershell-5 or powershell-core).

## Using a terminal

Many of the problems that I'm seeing originate in VS code!


## Checklist

- [ ] Verify that you can open a terminal NOT IN VSCODE!
- [ ] Verify pyenv, python, poetry, quarto and code from a terminal
- [ ] Disable managed app execution aliases
- [ ] Remove old versions of python using Add/Remove programs
- [ ] PYENV: Install pyenv
- [ ] Install python 3.11.6 using pyenv
- [ ] Install poetry (DO NOT USE PIP)
- [ ] VSCODE: install python extension 
- [ ] VSCODE: install quarto extension
- [ ] VSCODE: install mysql extensions 


## Details

### Cleaning

This process requires removal of previously installed versions of python, conda or others. It also requires disabling of Windows convienences that get in the way of python.

- [ ] Disable managed app execution aliases
- [ ] Remove old versions of python

### Install Pyenv

#### Install software
[Link to install instructions here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#powershell)

```{powershell}
# open an administrator Window

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine;
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1";

```

#### Set up environment

[Link to environment instructions](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#add-system-settings)

## Install Poetry

OUTSIDE of pyenv.  Do not use pyenv, rather use recommand poetry install

```{powershell}
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```
Then add this version of poetry to your path

- [ ] Control Panel | small icons | User Accounts | Change my environment variables

        %APPDATA%\Python\Scripts

## Update Powershell profile



```{powershell}

code $profile
then add:


$env:DENO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1               # to warning about deno upgrades
$env:DENO_TLS_CA_STORE="system"           # to stop the BAD CERTIFICATE deno warning
$env:PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION=1     # for Python 3.11 above, to disable warning message RE: debugging
$env:VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=0         # disable venv prompt change

$env:QUARTO_PYTHON=$(pyenv which python)  # to work with pyenv
$var = $(poetry env info -e 2> $null)
if ($var -ne $null) {
  Write-Output "Setting QUARTO_PYTHON for detected Poetry VENV"
  $env:QUARTO_PYTHON=$var                 # to work with venv in pyenv
}

```

## VS Code setup

- [ ] Set vscode to use powershell
- [ ] Set vscode to show current virtual environment
