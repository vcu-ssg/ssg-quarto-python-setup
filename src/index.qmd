***[Our goal](goal.qmd) is pyenv, python, poetry, vscode and quarto working seamlessly with python virtual environments from a command line.***

Getting your machine ready for software development can sometime be challenging, especially if over time you've accumulated lots of software on your computer.

This site offers a process for preparing your computer for python development using VS code and Quarto from the command line.  Those on Mac (zsh shell) and Linux (bash shell) have an easier time.  Those on Windows have a tougher time because of the multitude of shells (e.g., CMD, powershell-5 or powershell-core).

## About this site

Each section on the site offers guidance on individual installation and configuration steps.  The [final steps](finalsteps.qmd) section offers guidance on getting them all work together.

## Glossary of terms

To eliminate confusion I'll be using the following terms on this site:

VSC
: visual studio code. An awesome code editor and more.  See IDE below.

terminal
: A command line windows NOT inside VSC.  On windows we'll use a terminal window with powershell.  On mac you'll use terminal window with ZSH.  On linux you'll use a terminal windows with bash.

GUI
: a graphic user interface, often directly associated with the underlying operating system.

IDE
: an integrated development environment.  While very handy when learning to code, they quickly become a crutch for software engineers and coders.  PyCharm is one example of an IDE.

In closing, VSC is NOT an IDE although many people use it like an IDE.  VSC includes many features of an IDE and is very extensible.
However, VSC can also be used as a regular code editor, like VIM, EMACS or others.  Learn to use VSC from the command line!

## Checklist

If your system is not working or if you're starting from scratch, here is a general checklist:

- [ ] WINDOWS: disable python-related [app execution aliases](prework.qmd).
- [ ] Verify that you can [open a terminal](terminals.qmd) NOT IN VSC.
- [ ] Verify [pyenv and python](pyenv.qmd), [quarto](quarto.qmd), [poetry](poetry.qmd) and [VSC](vscode.qmd) from a terminal.
- [ ] Install and test missing pyenv, python, poetry, quarto and VSC.
- [ ] Verify environment variables are properly set using the $PROFILE (windows), .zschrc (mac), .bashrc (linux) files.

If the tools are *completely* installed in the correct order, everything should work out of the box in mac and linux.  The PC will require a few more tweaks.  (See [final steps](finalsteps.qmd))

## Troubleshooting

For the most part everyone has their tools already installed and the challenge is getting them to all work together.  Here are some tips:

* Be patient and methodical.  Debugging can be frustrating.  YOU GOT THIS!
* Get everything running outside of VSC before you try running inside VSC. (See [terminal](terminals.qmd))
* Verify that you did ALL the required install steps.  I've seen people not read the instructions completely and are left with half-working software.  This is VERY hard to debug!
* Verify that the individual tools are working by themselves.
* Use *quarto check* to see how things are working together.
* Once everything runs from a terminal then jump inside VSC to get it all running there.
* If you still have trouble, consider uninstalling/remove the tools and starting over.

Many of the problems that I've seen result from not completing the install.  For most software
engineering tools, simply installing the software is only the first part.

Many software tools require second or third steps that make the use of the installed software easier
from the command line.  RTFM
