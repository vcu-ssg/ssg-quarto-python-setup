title: Getting started with pyenv
---

Poetry should be installed outside of your current version python, that is DO NOT USE *pip install poetry*.
Why? If you install using *pip* then the command *poetry shell* will most probably fail.

Below are links to the instructions on the web.

1. Windows install of poetry
1. Mac install of poetry
1. Linux install of pietry

I summarize the installs in the tabset below.  The instructions below were accurate at the
time they were included in this document, but over time things may change.  Refer to the links
above.
