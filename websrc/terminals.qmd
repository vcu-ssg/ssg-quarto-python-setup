Many of the problems that I see originate in VSC!  The best way to make sure that everything is working is start with a command line terminal - a separate window OUTSIDE of VSC.  Then we'll get VSC working.

* Learn to work from a shell
* Learn to work without a mouse

## Windows

Press the *windows* key on the lower left of your keyboard.

*Without touching the mouse* starting typing the keyword *terminal* into the search bar. You only
need to enter the first few letters, then hit *enter*.
