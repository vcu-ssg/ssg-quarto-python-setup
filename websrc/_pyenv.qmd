title: Installing pyenv
---

pyenv is a manager program for python.  It lets you maintain several different versions of python
on your computers.  This is GREAT if you're developing more than one program over a longer period of time.
Pythons change and you don't want to have to constantly update older code when things change.


#### Install software
[Link to install instructions here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#powershell)
